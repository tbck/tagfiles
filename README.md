Slackware tagfiles
==================

Slackware installation tagfiles.

These tagfiles are stripped down for a minimal Slackware install. There may
still be a few missing libraries and dependencies but hopefully the kinks will
get ironed out.

This install is based around how I use my computer.
* Base utilities
* Wifi
* X11
* Basic WM
* Music/Videos
* Development
